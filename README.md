Question Answering System

A simple question answering system that finds the most similar sentence to a user's question in a given context.

How it Works

1. Reads context from a file (practice.txt)
2. Takes user input (question)
3. Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find the most similar sentence
4. Prints the answer if similarity score is above a threshold (0.2)
create a simple  text file in the same path in which your jupyter file is there.
